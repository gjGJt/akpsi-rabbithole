    <p> Thank you for considering the possibility that the QR code was not just for show. 
        I did not think this was worth doing as the person reading my application must be overtaxed reading a ton of applications already.
        But in the off chance that it does get viewed, I think the rabbit hole metaphor will really describe me well as a person. 
        I don't take things, features, or certain experiences for granted. I'll go the extra mile even if it results in 
        a small increase in overall utility or an unique experience. In this case, I was going for a world inside a world inside a world 
        concept but thought that would be overkill.
